Session kickoff snippet (paste at start of each session):

"Before making any changes, read AGENTS.md and docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md and follow them strictly. Always run tool/verify.sh and commit only when analyzer is clean (0 issues). Use Conventional Commits, keep an up-to-date plan, and update example/main.dart for any new or changed public API."
