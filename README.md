## muxa_xtream

An ergonomic Dart client for Xtream Codes IPTV portals. It provides strongly-typed models, resilient HTTP, URL builders for streams, EPG helpers, and optional M3U/XMLTV utilities. Designed to be reliable, secure, and easy to integrate in Dart or Flutter apps.

> Important: This package was authored as an experiment to see how far AIâ€‘assisted engineering can go in a real-world library. The codebase, docs, tests, and design decisions were developed with heavy AI assistance and careful human review.

## Repository Guidelines

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for contributor and development guidelines, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow rules (verify script, commit format, examples, hooks).

## Features

- Strongly-typed Xtream Codes client with clear, consistent errors
- Pluggable HTTP adapter with timeouts, retries, redirects, TLS options
- Cooperative cancellation support across requests and parsing
- URL builders for live, VOD, and series (HLS first with TS fallback)
- EPG helpers including short-EPG and channel-id fallbacks
- M3U and XMLTV helpers for quick ingestion and parsing
- Redaction-first logging to prevent leaking secrets

## Getting started

- Install Dart SDK and run `dart pub get` in the repo.
- Try the example app to exercise the public API as it evolves.
  - `dart run example/main.dart --portal https://your.portal/ --user USER --pass PASS`
  - The example is updated with every new API addition so you can quickly verify behavior end-to-end.

## Usage

- See `example/main.dart` for live usage of the APIs, including:
  - `XtreamClient.getUserAndServerInfo()`
  - Catalogs: `getLiveCategories`, `getVodCategories`, `getSeriesCategories`, and corresponding list fetchers
  - Details: `getVodInfo`, `getSeriesInfo`
  - EPG: `getShortEpg(streamId, limit)`
    - Note: some portals serve EPG only by `epg_channel_id` (not by `stream_id`).
      The client API also accepts `epgChannelId` and, when both are provided, retries internally if the `stream_id` query returns empty.
  - Diagnostics: `ping()` and `capabilities()`
  - URL builders: `liveUrl`, `vodUrl`, `seriesUrl`
  - Probe helper: `suggestStreamExtension`

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Quick start

Use the Xtream Codes client to query account info, catalogs, details, EPG, and build streaming URLs.

```dart
import 'package:muxa_xtream/muxa_xtream.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final portal = XtreamPortal(Uri.parse('http://your-portal.example:8080'));
  final creds = XtreamCredentials(user: 'username', pass: 'password');

  final client = XtreamClient(
    portal: portal,
    credentials: creds,
    options: XtreamClientOptions(
      // Tune as needed
      requestTimeout: const Duration(seconds: 15),
      logger: XtreamLogger.stdout(),
    ),
  );

  // Basic health
  await client.ping();
  final features = await client.capabilities();
  print('Features: ${features}');

  // Account and server
  final info = await client.getUserAndServerInfo();
  print('User: ${info.user.username} @ ${info.server.serverName}');

  // Catalogs
  final liveCats = await client.getLiveCategories();
  final live = await client.getLiveStreams(categoryId: liveCats.first.categoryId);
  print('First live channel: ${live.first.name}');

  // URL builders (no I/O)
  final hlsUrl = client.urls.liveUrl(streamId: live.first.streamId);
  print('HLS URL: $hlsUrl');
}
```

> Tip: prefer environment variables or a local-only config file for credentials. Avoid hard-coding secrets.

## Examples

- See `example/main.dart` for a runnable demo that exercises the public API.
- The example prints basic diagnostics and demonstrates catalogs, details, EPG, and URL builders.

---

## Capability notes

- Transport: pluggable HTTP adapter with timeouts, retries, redirects, TLS options, and header injection.
- Errors: consistent taxonomy (auth/network/parse/blocked/unsupported) with redaction to avoid leaking secrets.
- Models & parsing: tolerant JSON parsing with UTC normalization.
- URL builders: `liveUrl`, `vodUrl`, `seriesUrl` default to HLS with TS fallback; probing helper available.
- M3U & XMLTV: optional helpers for `get.php` and streaming XMLTV parse with cancellation.
- Reliability: cancellation and timeouts propagate end-to-end.

---

## Install

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  muxa_xtream: ^latest
```

Then:

```sh
dart pub get
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a call fails with an HTML response, the portal may be blocked or behind a captive page; check `XtPortalBlockedError`.
- For 401/403, verify credentials and IP whitelist.
- For timeouts, increase `requestTimeout` in `XtreamClientOptions` or check connectivity.

---

## Security

- Never commit credentials.
- Logs are redacted by default; avoid logging raw responses that may contain secrets.
- See `AGENTS.md` for repository and contribution guidelines.

## Additional information

- Documentation: see the `doc/` folder for API notes, design, and integration guidance.
- Example: run `dart run example/main.dart` to try common flows end-to-end.
- Issues and contributions: please read `AGENTS.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`, then open issues/PRs with clear repro steps and expected behavior.
- Security: never include credentials in issues; redact sensitive URLs or logs.
